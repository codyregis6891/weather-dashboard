# weather-dashboard

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a live weather dashboard that would request live weather data via API keys nad retrieve the information and post it to the application.  

I was able to accomplish this task, and by using my presonally generated API keys, I was able to get the information on the weather forecasts and live updates, and transfer this information to my live application. 

Below is a screenshot of the live application and a link to the site:
